# Magic Button Task

Dear students,

In this homework assignment, you will be tasked with creating a React application that features a "Magic Button." When this button is clicked, it should dynamically add another button with a different style (e.g., background color), and all the buttons should be displayed in a list.

## Task Instructions

Please follow the steps below to complete the task:

### 1. Create the Magic Button Component

Start by creating a new React component called "MagicButton." This component will serve as the main interface for the user to trigger the addition of new buttons.

### 2. Implement the Button Addition Logic

Inside the "MagicButton" component, implement the logic that adds a new button whenever the "Magic Button" is clicked. You can use `react.cloneElement` to create new buttons with different styles (e.g., different background colors) each time the "Magic Button" is clicked.

### 3. Display Buttons in a List

Create another React component,to display the buttons. Inside this component, utilize `react.children.map` to map through the children (the dynamically generated buttons) and render them in a list format.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.
